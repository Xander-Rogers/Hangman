For a full description of the game, please view the README.txt file, which can be accessed within the game, as well as through a text editor.

Information about each function within the hangman program can be found in the docstrings, and comments in the hangman program itself. 

This project is not a perfect example of how to build a hangman game, however use it to your hears desire, and feel free to send me your thoughts.
