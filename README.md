# Hangman
Hangman Game w/ Tkinter

In order for this game to run, the tkinter library will need to be installed, this can be done through using pip, and executing pip install tk in 

the commandline/terminal, or by downloading the source code from here: https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.10/Lib/tkinter. 

For a full description of the game, please view the README.txt file, which can be accessed within the game, as well as through a text editor.

Information about each function within the hangman program can be found in the docstrings, and comments in the hangman program itself. 

This project is not a perfect example of how to build a hangman game, however use it to your hearts desire, and feel free to send me your 

thoughts.
