HANGMAN THE GAME: Developed By Xander Rogers, Graphics Engine by John Zelle

Getting started:
The game of Hangman is a relatively simplistic game. The player who is guessing a word attempts to find the correct
word by consecutively guessing letters which could be in the word. The game is over and the player wins if the word
is found. Otherwise, the  player is penalized by the addition of an element to the Hangman diagram (Such as right
arm, left arm, head, body, etc.). The player loses if he or she makes enough inaccurate guesses to reach the limit
(in this version there are 7 allowable guesses. However, before the diagram is completed, the guesser can win by
guessing all of the letters that occur in the word and thereby completing the word.

Playing the game:
The MAIN MENU is where the player can select one of three varying game difficulties: Easy, Medium, or Hard.
Easy is a three to four letter word combination, with words ranging alphabetically a-z. This is the best game mode
for first time or younger players, as it slowly introduces the mechanics of the game to the player. Medium is a possible
five, six, or seven letter word combination, with words ranging alphabetically a-z. This is more challenging, as it is
more difficult to guess a word with more than four letters, and also randomizes the chances of getting a five, six, or
seven letter word in each play-through. Hard is an eight letter word combination, with words ranging alphabetically a-y.
This is the hardest mode, as the difficulty of eight letter words increases significantly. This is true, as in many
account creation wizards, the typical, minimum length of a password allowed is eight characters. Once a player has
selected a difficulty, the game proceeds to the HANGMAN window.

In the HANGMAN window, the player is presented with Main Menu button, the Guess button, the Instructions button, and a
white box where letters that have been previously guessed are displayed. The box at the center of the screen is the grid
in which any failed attempts will be drawn to the screen as an element of the Hangman diagram. The small text field next
to the Guess button is where the player can input a single character a-z as their letter guess. Only one guess can be
made at a time, and once a letter is found, any identical letters in the word will be presented in the field where there
are separated underscores i.e., : "_ e _ e." If a player makes an incorrect guess, the player is notified of the letters
absence in the word, and an element of the Hangman will be drawn.

Winning & Losing:
If a player is successful in guessing all of the letters for the word, the player is notified of their success in green,
has the full word displayed, and receives a smily face as confirmation. If a player is unsuccessful in guessing all of
the letters in the word, the player is notified of their failure in red, has the full word displayed, and recives a
Hangman diagram completely filled out in red.

Menu functions:
The Main Menu button opens the PAUSED window, allowing the player to return to the MAIN MENU window without closing,
or playing the game in its entirety. Once the Main Menu button is pressed, the game is stopped, and there is no
returning to the previous status of the last game played. Upon completion of a round of Hangman, the Quit and Play Again?
button appear in the lower hands of the window. If Quit is selected the window closes and the Hangman game ceases to run.
If Play Again? is selected, the MAIN MENU window is reopened, and the game can be replayed at a new, or same difficulty.

Conclusions/Questions:
While the game is not extremely, visually appealing, it demonstrates the versatility of python as a coding language.
Additionally, the usage of modules to produce programs that function on a higher level is one of the beauties of python.
Furthermore, python makes data manipulation much easier, and faster to script out in comparison to other high level
languages. Overall, creating this was a fun experience, and had me employ critical thinking skills frequently.
